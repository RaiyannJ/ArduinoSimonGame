# ArduinoSimonGame

A Color Memory game (similar to Simon) was created using an Arduino UNO R3.

The game has 4 difficulty levels (yellow being the easiest, blue being the hardest) with random game patterns. Once victory/defeat is achieved, a corresponding tune and message on a serial monitor is played!

The code required extensive uses of for loop and memory tracking (DP) to ensure game functions properly!
